Technique is awesome iff:
    - workers are cheap                                              if the mapped function is slow  
    - steel is cheap                                                 if the input data is hard to come by
    - land is cheap                                                  memory: 16Gb DRAM (200 cycles) o--> L1/L2/L3 4/12/60
    - people can only buy your cars

Kept inventory                                                       Just in time manufacturing

Python stored most data in lists.                                    Python can make iterators
